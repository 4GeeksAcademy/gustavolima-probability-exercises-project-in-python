# Probability Exercises in Python
<!-- endhide -->

This is a small exercise, where I explore working with probabilities in Python. The idea is to understand how to layout the problems and find solutions for the problems üõ†Ô∏è. 

With a special focus on NumPy package, I solved typical probabilities problems with dices, balls, always having preset the idea of "Random" and "Luck".
The specific exercices help understand how powerful mastering Python, NumPy and Mathematics can solve and test probabilities of the real world. 

## Key Takes 

The most important take of this exercise is to understand and learn how useful and simple it is to lay down problems in Python and get the answers you need to your problems or testing out hypothesis before diving into more data exploration in my case. 
At the same time working with probabilities is a good way to learn about conditionals and loops in Python. Two essential principles of coding that one needs to fully master and understand to be able to do anything with programming.
